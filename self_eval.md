# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
If you have to compare variables and make different decisions based on them.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I think I would try naming my commits a bit better, as well as add more comments to my scripts even though they're very simple. 

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Today I caught up on all my work, as I was behind due to receiving my laptop late. I feel proud that I caught up, because I am now on track to a great education and future.
